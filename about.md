### Hello, I'm Alex!

I am an Associate Product Manager at Google where I am working to organize the world's information as part of the Knowledge Graph team. I am currently based in San Francisco.

I mash keys on a midi keyboard and try to make music under the name [Enforced By Aircraft](https://soundcloud.com/enforced-by-aircraft).

If you need to get in touch, please drop me an email at [my first name]@roe.io
