Looking back on my passions, interests, and life over the past 23 years, I have to admit that one recurring theme has stood out: I am consistently inconsistent. 

Whether that be guitar, working out, my faith, or friendships, I struggle greatly with consistency. I have these stretches of time (albeit often brief ) where I find myself fully devoted to whatever cause it is at the moment and pouring myself fully into it. But please don't ask me about this same cause two weeks later for I have surely moved on.

I find that this thought best reflects itself in the graveyard of side projects that sit on my computer. How many ideas have I been excited about, and rushed off to start writing code, only to find myself burnt out and onto the next thing shortly. 

In order to become better, I propose that I need to develop three themes better in my life: *habit*, *focus*, and *discipline*. 

###Habit
Without habit, there can be no consistency. What is the most consistent behavior (aside from necessary bodily functions) in my life? Brushing my teeth. Why? Because it's a habit that by this point has become ingrained in my nature now. When I don't brush my teeth in the morning or at night, I feel a pang of guilt. It is a great forcing function to get me to do it every day. Likewise with any of these other aspirational behaviors in my life, I need to make them a habit. 

###Focus
I am easily bored. I feel like every week there is something else that I am excited about and convinced that I need to be working on immediately. Unfortunately, this is not a very focused lifestyle. How can one ever expect to get truly better at something if that something changes every week? It's impossible. I need to focus more on what is important to me in the moment, and be weary of any distractions.

###Discipline
Both habit and focus could be boiled down to discipline. It's very interesting "becoming an adult" and having your own place, own income, and no one telling you you have to do. For perhaps the first time in your life, you don't have to answer to anyone else. As a result, it is up to yourself to develop discipline. This is a hard thing. How does one define and hold oneself to the standards that they have set? This seems key to me if I want to develop better consistency. 

So with those three themes defined, thus begins the start of my journey to becoming consistent. I hope to look back to October 24th as a turning point in my life.
