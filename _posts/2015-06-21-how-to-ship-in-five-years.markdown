Recently, the switch for our iOS game [DRXN](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drxn/id979064633?mt=8) was switched in iTunes Connect to "for sale" and officially launched to the public. It was a joyous moment for Clay Goddard (the "G" in [Groe Games](http://groegames.com)) and I that has been five years in the making. Now before you look at the app and think "five years?" and ask if we had spent our dictating code to an iguana who then typed our code into Xcode, we did not (don't be ridiculous, iguanas can only type 30 WPM). DRXN itself was actually about two months in the making, but the process of Clay and I launching a product has been a five year long road.

Five years ago we had started our path at Georgia Tech. As first year students (graduating from Tech in four years is uncommon so students identify themselves as first years, second years,  and then just old) we became friends and quickly decided that we were going to make something great. Clay was a Computer Science major and once I had found out that he had made the [Lemonade World](http://www.addictinggames.com/strategy-games/lemonadeworld.jsp) flash game that wasted many of my middle school afternoons, I decided that he was as the cool kids say, 1337, and I wanted to make something cool like that as well. Only problem was that I was an Industrial Engineer major and had a limited technical background. So of course, I became the "business guy" because EVERY great startup has a business guy! I went to the campus bookstore and bought "How to Create Your First LLC" and we were on the way. We decided to make a social network for greek life. "The Composite" is what we were going to call it (still a great name).  Success was inevitable. Excpet that turns out a two person company with one person pulling all the weight and a "business" guy didn't work out so well for us. We decided to say forget it and spend the rest of our freshman year enjoying college life and playing minecraft.

Fast forward a year and Clay and I were living together. I had found a knack and passion for programming, switched my major to Computer Science and was chomping at the bit to once again, launch something interesting. From this time until we graduated, we tried a plethora of ideas. Looking through the graveyard of my github and project folder, our projects included:

- a 2d fantasy RPG that included a fantastic storyline and the dreaded enemy boss MADZOG
- a local event aggregator
- a social picture sharing app a la Snapchat stories
- app to better organize collections of your favorite things
- using bitcoin as a filtering mechanism for emails
- The Composite (again!)
- a rogue-like open space exploration rpg
- a consulting company

<br />
And that's just scratching the surface. We didn't just have those ideas, think about it for a little bit, and move on, but we actually built out versions of all of the above projects to varying degrees. We used Python, Java, Ruby, Swift, Objective C, Rails, Django, Arduino, whatever it took to get stuff done. We were technology, framework, and language agnostic. We tried to not get bogged down by any tools and instead, select the right tools for the job. Yet we failed, we failed miserably to ever let any of of these projects grace the eyes of anyone but ourselves. After FOUR YEARS of computer science coursework, CS internships at startups and large companines, countless hours spent hacking around on various whims and thoughts, we had absolutely nothing to show for it. 

Fast forward to early 2015. Clay had graduated and has been working full time since last May. I graduated at the end of December (had to get an extra football season in) and was to start work full time in March. We were at a coffee shop in Atlanta catching up and we started talking about ideas once again. We talked about our aspirations about running our own company one day, and how we "just need to make something". This conversation is a typical one between us and normally it leads to a few days of heightened productivity and excitement about an idea and then nothing. This time was different.

We both agreed to actually make quick prototypes of a game incredibly limited in scope. Here's a picture of the first screenshot from the prototype that was to become DRXN:

We didn't focus on graphics. We didn't focus on nice UIs. We just focused on making a fun game mechanic. And we shared it super early! After a week of working on it, the "pre-alpha" was ready and was sent out to a group of friends for testing. Here's what the pre-alpha menu looked like (12 inch duck was our first pass at a company name):

It had some great "features" like crashing if the level you entered was too high, but that was perfectly ok. We just needed feedback.

We continued to iterate and flesh out DRXN. Clay was working full time and I had just started full time, but we ended up finishing most of the work in about a month of work and then took another month for polish, tweaking performance, and getting it ready for the App store.

We ended up shipping it in early May, ~two months after the first commit, ~five years after we had first started working on our first project together. It was an incredible feeling to flip to "for sale" in iTunes Connect and see DRXN in the App Store. It is an amazing and empowering feeling when you know you've thought of something, created it from scratch, and then released it to the world for others to use and enjoy. We are going to do it again. And this time it's not going to take 5 years. 

If you would like to check out DRXN, it's free on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drxn/id979064633?mt=8).
