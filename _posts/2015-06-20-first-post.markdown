As my very first post, I would like to start with a passage from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations. 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Let your every action, word, and thought be those of one who could depart from life at any moment.
  </p>

What an incredible passage. I spent some time thinking about how my life would look if I took this to heart and more importantly, put it into action. I thought about some high level categories for how I would like to spend my time outside of work:

* learning
* cultivating relationships
* creating

<br />
A person's attention, energy, and time are all finite. As such, to waste these resources doing anything that does not contribute to your life for the better is a gross waste of the most precious gift that you have ever recieved. As a caveat, I think that it is important to define these categories for yourself and think about pursing them in ways that are replinishing to yourself. If you find yourself doing something that you don't want to or feel stressed about, stop. Pursing opportunities, ideas or relationships that stress you out or you are not 100% excited about is a recipie for burnout. And burnout is the enemy
