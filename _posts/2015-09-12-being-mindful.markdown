I've been on this earth for over 23 years now. As I get older, I realize that time goes by more and more quickly. 

Looking back over the past six months of my life, a lot has happened. I moved across the country away from my friends and family. I started a full time job. I've grown accustomed to my routines. I have started to become comfortable. I go to work. I make it to the weekend. Monday creeps up. Repeat.

What have I done lately that has made me uncomfortable? What have I done lately that has made me a better person? What have I done consistently in order to move one step closer to my dream?

If we're not careful, this life will pass us by. Dreams will become a series of "I could have" or "If only I would have tried a little harder". We'll accept that they were dreams and that we were never meant to actually accomplish them.  

Screw that.
